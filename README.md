# Car Leasing Calculator

This is a web application using HTML, CSS and JavaScript (JavaScript HTML DOM) that calculates the costs of car leasing.
The application includes the following components:
- main.css - the CSS file defines the style of the application. The shadow is added using the box-shadow property. The @media rule defines the behavior of the application on narrower (mobile) screens.
- cartype.js - the class defining the car types (used and new) and their interest rates.
- calculator.js - the class including the draw() method, which draws the elements of the webpage.
  The leasing details are being calculated and updated using the updatevalues() inner function, which calculates the monthly installment, down payment and the total leasing cost.
